# Some background

As a general guiding principle, I try not to pay much attention to Twitter's _quote prompt du jour_. But the one going around this past week gave me the opportunity to reflect on music I like and give recommendations to an audience I pretend actually cares, so I gave in and decided to engage in one of my favorite activities: putting a far greater amount of thought into it than it deserves.

This particular version of the trend was adapted from one asking the same question of movies. This is made apparent by the accompanying image being a guy eating popcorn in a movie theatre. Except now the word _movie_ has been covered up by the word _album_. Couldn't put in the effort to find a picture of a guy jamming out or something I guess. So I crudely drew some headphones and a 3rd generation iPod on the guy. I've since seen at least one person using my shitty edit and I hope it spreads. It looks like this:

The post ended up with 25 likes, meaning I've selected albums all the way down until 1998. For a while I was putting so much thought into each selection that I found the process closer to painful than I did fun. What eventually became freeing was interpreting the _"1 favorite album"_ part of the prompt as meaning _a_ favorite, not _the_ favorite. And so I could continue on without feeling I've slighted something, though I still did feel that way.

# On selection criteria

What I started out wanting to do was highlight some of the wilder favorites I have. I think it yields a much more interesting end product than it just being the same shit you've seen dozens of times. This did serve as a guideline for my selection process, but to some degree it ended up morphing into it just being a list of albums that mean a lot to me. Which is fine! Just, don't expect any true consistency in my choices.

I also avoided repeats. I could have easily, for example, chosen A Winged Victory For the Sullen's debut album, but I knew Stars of the Lid would appear further into the list and as such chose something else. This created some weird juggling around of picks, but I do think a list without explicit repeats is more compelling. That said, I did choose an Aaron Dilloway solo album and a Wolf Eyes album from when he was still in the band, so again, extremely loose guidelines.

I tried to not end up with a list of just ambient or noise or whatever, but on account of being a boring white guy the genre representation is pretty lacking. And for completely arbitrary reasons I decided against choosing a live album, so I guess that's part of the criteria I almost certainly would have abandoned had the likes gotten me all the way to 1977.

Which, I guess, all of this is to say: I picked whatever the hell I felt like, for whatever the hell reasons I felt like.

# Etc., and so forth, blah blah blah

I wanted to make this post so that I could explain some of the process in a way that simply isn't possible in Twitter posts. It was a fun little thought experiment and one that maybe I'll end up continuing regardless of the number of likes.

There were also a great number of things I feel were terrible omissions, so maybe this will get me to take some dives into specific years if the interest is there. If I do, I will probably keep it off Twitter though, as I'm truly incapable of writing anything at all about an album in 280 characters. I can't write anything at all anymore anyway because I have gotten so fucking stupid in the past decade or so, but given unlimited words I can at least pretend.

Hope even one person got anything out of this whole thing: if so, it is all worth it. Be well.

# The playlist

I have taken a song from each album and turned it into a playlist/"mixtape", which you can listen to in one of two ways:
- Streaming as a full mix, embedded below, or
- As downloadable FLAC/MP3 + .m3u8 playlist files.

Spotify can suck on my ass, not using it for the past two years has been one of the greatest decisions of my life. Files for life.
