I don't know what I'm going to use this web's sight for. Probably just going to write about being a depressed piece of shit, starting therapy, all that kind of shit. A shout into the void so as to be less of an annoyance on social media platforms and to have less of a presence on all of those world-ruining places.

This site is built using Jekyll and its default theme Minima.
